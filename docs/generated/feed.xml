            <title><![CDATA[[updated] Qiskit Runtime (quantum-computing) has changed the description of the plan named paygo-standard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[*before*: Systems = Two 27 qubit Falcon processors. Time limits= program-specific up to 8 hours. Qiskit Runtime Second = quantum compute time and near time classical pre- and post-processing. No charge for job queue time., *after*: Systems = Two 27 qubit Falcon processors. Time limits= program-specific up to 8 hours. Qiskit Runtime Second = quantum compute time and near time classical pre- and post-processing. No charge for job queue time.
Simulators = 5 (QASM, statevector, mps, stabilizer, and extended stabilizer). Time limits = program-specific up to 3 hours.]]></description>
