            <title><![CDATA[[updated] Hyper Protect Crypto Services (hs-crypto) has changed the description of the plan named hpcs-hourly-uko]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[*before*: For distinct access to your key management service keys, keys can be created in separate vaults. Vaults are secure repositories for your cryptographic keys and keystores. A managed key or target keystore can only be in one vault at a time. A managed key can only be used for encryption and decryption when it is installed in at least one target keystore. You can install a managed key in multiple target keystores, internal or external, even across clouds such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform. Manage the lifecycle of the managed key from the vault. When you make changes to the managed key, the vault keeps its all installed keys in sync. You can have up to 5 free internal keystores and 1 free external keystore. The Unified Key Orchestrator hourly base price is applied as soon as you connect to an external keystore for the service instance., *after*: For distinct access to your key management service keys, keys can be created in separate vaults.
