            <title><![CDATA[[updated] Qiskit Runtime (quantum-computing) has changed the description of the plan named paygo-standard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[*before*: **Systems**
127 qubit Eagle processors. Time limits = program-specific up to 8 hours. Qiskit Runtime Second = time counted to process a job. No charge for job queue time.

**Simulators**
*(Note: Simulators are deprecated and will be removed soon)*
Five simulators (QASM, statevector, mps, stabilizer, and extended stabilizer). Time limits = program-specific up to 3 hours. 

**Performance management strategies**
Two strategies:
  • IBM 3 resilience levels.
  • Q-CTRL AI-driven automated error reduction. **No additional cost. Only available in us-east region**., *after*: **Quantum processing units**
