            <title><![CDATA[[updated] Key Protect (kms) has changed the description of the plan named tiered-pricing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[*before*: First 20 keys are free. Then after that it's $0.75 per key per month for up to 1,000 more keys. Then after that it's $0.60 per key per month for up to 9,000 more keys. Then after that it's $0.50 per key per month for each additional key., *after*: Creating or importing a key initiates the first version of that key. As a result, a newly created or imported key has one version. Each time a key is rotated, a new key version is created. A key that has been rotated five times, then, has six versions (five versions created by rotations plus the initial version). Deleted keys and their versions are not counted.]]></description>
