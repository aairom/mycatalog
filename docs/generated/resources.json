The snapshots are stored in Cloud Object Storage.\n\nThe first snapshot is a full backup of the volume. The subsequent snapshots of the same volume are incremental; they capture only the changes that occurred since the last snapshot was taken. \n\nYou can take snapshots of individual volumes and you can create a consistency group to take snapshots of multiple volumes that are attached to the same VSI simultaneously.\n\nYou can use these snapshots later to create stand-alone data volumes, provision new virtual server instances, or add new data volumes to existing virtual server instance. You can use the snapshots to recover operations after a disastrous event or to expand your VPC to other regions.",

IBM Cloud Backup is an enterprise-level backup storage and disaster recovery solution that is available for local access across globally dispersed data centers. With IBM Cloud Backup, you can add cloud-based backup to any physical, virtual, or hybrid server environment, leverage system image and granular recovery options and restore capabilities for dissimilar hardware, and schedule backups and retention schemes to follow custom timetables or employ the daily, or weekly preconfigured schedules as needed. Backups can target full systems, specific directories, or even individual files, and will incorporate block-level change processing, data deduplication, and intelligent on-the-fly compression, and employ point and click downed-system restoration, from central management and administration via a very intuitive web-based utility from anywhere in the world. With end-to-end encryption that is enforced for IBM Cloud Backup, your data is always secure – from source to vault, and can scale as needed, to satisfy all of your backup workload requirements.",

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your block storage volume. The entire contents of the volume are copied and retained. Subsequent snapshots will capture the incremental changes from the previous snapshots.\n\n#### Pricing\n\nYou will be charged for the storage capacity used for each of your backups.

    "longDescription": "Agile Digital Workplace:\nAccess documents, files, emails and relevant applications quickly and securely, anytime, anywhere – enabling a truly agile digital workplace to improve cost and time efficiencies.\n\nComputing in the modern workplace:\nWhen it comes to the computing experience in your business, how easy is it for you to access the system and relevant applications? Chances are you’re rolling your eyes because it’s probably a little hit and miss. Right?\n\nIf you’re office-based, do you find yourself turning on your laptop and heading to the kitchen to make coffee while the system loads? When you’re travelling on a train, do you have to wait ages to open a single file? And if you’re working from home, do you get frustrated with how long it takes to send an email? Have you simply got used to circumventing the workflow to allow for inefficiencies in the existing IT system?\n\nMany UK companies and organisations employ a range of functionality to deliver IT. A mix of Cloud, on-premise and legacy systems in place, all evolving over time, can lead to an inefficient and cumbersome platform that is simply not fit for purpose. This poses challenges for everyone from end users to IT teams:\n\nDifficulty in accessing information quickly and reliably, irrespective of whether you’re in the office or on the move\nDifferent passwords for different systems\nInadequate cybersecurity protocols for remote working access\nHaving uniform, fast, secure and reliable ‘round-the-clock’ access to every piece of information you need to do your job efficiently and effectively is imperative for commercial success. Irrespective of your location, whether you’re office-based or on the move, you need data, documents, files, spreadsheets, emails and everything in between instantly at your fingertips. Not possible? Think again. With etiCloud Agile Digital Workplace you can have all of this, and more, in one single place.",

IBM Cloud® File Storage for VPC is backed by All-Flash architecture. You can create file shares with capacity that ranges from 10 GB to 32 TB with flexible options. You can mount the file share on multiple IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for file sharing and collaboration. You have total control over your data as you manage access to the file shares with IAM profiles, security groups, and context-based restrictions. You can also bring your own root keys to add another layer of encryption. You can manage your cost by provisioning only what you need. You can increase the share capacity later when you need more storage, and you can adjust the IOPS to increase or decrease performance anytime.",

You can create a custom image on premises and import it to your IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure from IBM Cloud Object Storage. \n2. You can create a custom image of a boot volume that is attached to a virtual server instance at import time. For more information, see [about creating an image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc).\nImages are private to the account that they're imported to. New virtual server instance deployments are limited to the region where the image is imported. For more information about importing custom images, see [importing custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-importing-custom-images-vpc). For more information about managing custom images, see [Managing custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-custom-images).\n\nYou have many considerations when you create a custom image, such as operating systems, image requirements, and whether you want to share your custom image to a private catalog.

Komprise is a data management service that connects easily via open standards to any file storage to provide much-needed analytics and visibility across all storage silos.\n\nKey benefits for customers include optimizing the management of petabytes of unstructured data to accelerate cloud migrations while dramatically cutting costs. Komprise automatically migrates or tiers unstructured/file data to secondary storage according to the plans which users create so that data always lives in the right place at the right time according to its age, usage or other parameters such as security.\n\nThis adds up to significant storage savings (up to 70%) from migrating and archiving data. Komprise’s elastic grid architecture and patented TMT (transparent move technology) ensures that once data is moved from NAS and cloud file services, users can always access files from the original location, in their original form, without getting in the hot data path and enabling native access in the destination storage.",

Once the client is connected, you can safely connect your applications and resources by specifying their host and port to create corresponding destinations on the cloud. Rather than bridging your environments at the network level like a traditional VPN that begins with full access and must be limited from the top down, Secure Gateway provides granular access only to the resources that you have defined.",

    "description": "Subnet for VPC",
    "longDescription": "Subnets are created from VPC address prefixes and are bound to a single zone in one region; customers can have multiple subnets per address prefix. \n\nEach subnet in a VPC can reach other subnets through private layer 3 routing through the implicit router. The implicit router is the inherent network connectivity between all the subnets that are created within a VPC. A VPC, like a subnet, is also deployed and bound to only one region. Within that region, a VPC can span multiple zones, however, subnets are bound to a single zone and do not span multiple zones.",

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance.

Each project is fully detailed with project plan, associated cost and transparency to the project status with focus on rapid achievement of critical path objectives.\n\nAll projects, irrespective of category and customization, require a current state assessment coupled with a solid understanding of the customer goal and associated target environment.  Once well-comprehended, an accurate statement of work and associated price quote is generated in support of the project.  At such time, the project can be procured through the listed catalog option.",
